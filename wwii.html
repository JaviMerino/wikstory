              Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an
              Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi
              Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche
              Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers
              Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and
              dictator of Nazi Germany (as Führer und Reichskanzler) from
              1934 to 1945. He was at the centre of the founding of
              Nazism, World War II, and the Holocaust.

              Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (18 December 1878 – 5
              March 1953) was the de facto leader of the Soviet Union from the
              mid-1920s until his death in 1953. Initially appointed as the General
              Secretary of the party's Central Committee in 1922, Stalin managed to
              consolidate power following the 1924 death of Vladimir Lenin through
              expanding the functions of the role, all the while working to
              eliminate any opposition to his political agenda. He held his original
              post until abolishing it in 1952, concurrently serving as the Premier
              of the Soviet Union after establishing the position in 1941. Stalin's
              regime developed a highly centralised command economy, launching a
              period of industrialization and collectivization that resulted in the
              rapid transformation of the USSR from an agrarian society into an
              industrial power. However, the economic changes coincided with the
              imprisonment of several million people in Soviet correctional labour
              camps and the deportation of many others to remote areas within the
              state. The initial upheaval in agriculture disrupted food
              production and contributed to the catastrophic Soviet famine of
              1932–1933; the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in particular was
              subjected to such mass starvation that it would later be referred to
              by its own name, the Holodomor. Later, in a period that lasted from
              1936-39, Stalin instituted a campaign against alleged enemies of his
              regime called the Great Purge in which hundreds of thousands were
              executed. Major figures in the Communist Party such as the old
              Bolsheviks, Leon Trotsky, and several Red Army leaders were killed
              after being convicted of plotting to overthrow the Soviet regime.

              Franklin Delano Roosevelt January 30, 1882 – April 12,
              1945), also known by his initials, FDR, was the 32nd
              President of the United States (1933–1945) and a central
              figure in world events during the mid-20th century,
              leading the United States during a time of worldwide
              economic depression and total war. A dominant leader of
              the Democratic Party and the only American president
              elected to more than two terms, he built a New Deal
              Coalition that realigned American politics after 1932, as
              his domestic policies defined American liberalism for the
              middle third of the 20th century.

              Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, KG, OM, CH, TD, PC, DL, FRS,
              Hon. RA (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British politician,
              best known for his leadership of the United Kingdom during the Second
              World War. Widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of
              the 20th century, he served as Prime Minister twice (1940–45 and
              1951–55). A noted statesman and orator, Churchill was also an officer
              in the British Army, a historian, a writer, and an artist. He is the
              only British prime minister to have received the Nobel Prize in
              Literature and was the first person to be made an Honorary Citizen of
              the United States.
